![--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/assets/lines/grass.png)

## üìã Abstract

With the rapid development of Internet technology and the global penetration of the internet, there is a surge in demand for customised applications for every need. As a result, several application distribution platforms are available to meet this demand. The Google Play Store is the most popular of these. It is the world's largest app store, hosting around 3 million apps in 2020, with 2.5 billion active Android users. Google App Store is a brand in and of itself, with over 2 billion active monthly users. The fact that the Google Android app store has received over 115 billion downloads in the last year demonstrates its growing popularity. With the growing popularity of the Android platform around the world, there has been a growing demand for Android apps to be recognised separately. Furthermore, mobile developers desired to upload Android apps and provide ongoing support. So, for that app, it is critical to understand which factors are responsible for the application's success in the Play Store. The goal of this project is to provide insights that will help developers better understand customer demands and thus popularise the product. We attempted to discover relationships between various attributes such as whether the application is free or paid, what user reviews are available, and the application's rating.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap and Navigation guide

The whole project is divided into the six phases, Where in each phase we are dealing with one ascept of the data analysis. As far as the navigation is consorn it's mutch more easy as the process is carried out in phases. for example if we just want we see the analysis then we can directly move to the <b>Process</b> section or if we just what to see the insides then we go ahead and see the <b>Share</b> section of the phase.
In the real-world depending upon the organization the data analysis phases defination may subjected to chage. the the core model is always same. and each phace more or less is representative of that abstract model. So, in this project we try to replicate this real-world abstract process. The main advantage of adopting this model is that the process looks more clear and we have more focus towards goals rether than just chucking the numbers.
<br>

<b>The following bits are clearly explain this abstract process.</b>
<br>

<li><b>Ask</b> questions to make data driven decision.</li>
--> Define problem and confirm stackholder expectation.

<li><b>Prepare</b> data for exploration.</li>
--> Collect and store data for analysis.

<li><b>Process</b> data form dirty to clean.</li>
--> Clean and transform data to ensure data integrity.

<li><b>Analyze</b> data to answer.</li>
--> Use data analysis tools to draw conclusions.

<li><b>Share</b> data through the art of visulization.</li>
--> Interpret and communicate result for data-driven decision.

<li><b>Act</b> on the insides to make real-time change.</li>
--> Put your insides to work in order to solve problem.
